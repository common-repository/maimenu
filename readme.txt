== Description ==

 

The Maimenu for restaurant menus plugin allows you to insert your restaurant menus  anywhere in your site with the simple short code [maimenu].

Once you have created your perfect menu on Maimenu, you can use this plugin to insert it anywhere in your WordPress site using the simple short code [maimenu]. 

When you update your menu on Maimenu, your information will automatically be published on your WordPress site and on Maimenu’s  site. 

**How does it work?**

**Step 1: Create an account at Maimenu.it **
 

**Step 2: Retrieve your menu**
If your menu  is already online, chances are that it already exists in the Maimenu database. You’ll simply need to retrieve it and make edits (if required) before publishing it. If your menu  is not already available on Maimenu, you can simply create it from Maimenu's backend. 

**Step 3: Edit your menu**
Once your menu or price list has been claimed or created in Maimenu, use our easy-to-use menu editor to make any required changes. When you’ve finalized everything, click on the “Save” button in the  bottom of the page.    

**Step 4: Retrieve the HTML snippet on Maimenu to publish on your WordPress site**
In the left-sidebar of your Maimenu dashboard, click on the “Publish and share” button. Copy the HTML snippet that displays in the textarea. 

**Step 5: Use the plugin to generate the [maimenu] shortcode**
Paste the HTML snippet generated in step 4 in the text area of the plugin and click the "Save" button.

**Step 6: Use the [maimenu] shortcode**
You’re now ready to use the [maimenu] shortcode to insert your awesome menu   anywhere in your WordPress site!
